# Factors contributing to antibiotic  misuse among parents  of schoolâ€‘going children in Dhaka City, Bangladesh

##description
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a pressing global health concern, especially in resource-constrained countries, such as Bangladesh. This study aimed to identify the factors contributing to antibiotic misuse by assessing knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP). A cross-sectional study was conducted from August 20 to August 30, 2022, among 704 parents of school-going children in Dhaka South City. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the KAP, and multivariate models, including linear  and ordinal logistic regression, were used to explore the associations between these factors.
